    "title": "The AI (Artificial Interviewer)",
    "objectives": "An organisation is planning to introduce an AI system to perform an initial filter on job applications made in order to reduce the amount of applications that require human interview. The purpose of the system is to perform an initial assessment of a candidate's application, including their CV. The application process will ask applicants to respond to scenario based questions to assess their skills and behaviours against the relevant person specification. Certain aspects of the CV will be anonymised in order to manage potential bias in the system. This includes suppression of personal details. Other information collected as part of the process, such as those related to Diversity and Inclusion are not collected and used as part of the algorithm.\n\nObjective: To enable a scalable and efficient job application process for the organisation to increase quality of the process, for the organisation and the applicant, as well as deliver cost and resource savings.",
