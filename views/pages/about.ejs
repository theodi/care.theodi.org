    <h1>Data we collect about you and your project</h1>
    <div class="infobox">
      <h2>Your account</h2>
      <p>In order to use this tool you must hold a valid account with the Open Data Institute. You can regisiter for a new account <a href="https://theodi.org/account/register/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Upon logging in, this tool collects the following data about you:
        <ul>
          <li>Name (first name and last name)</li>
          <li>EMail</li>
          <li>Time and date of login</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Project data</h2>
      <p>All the data you create is stored in a centralised database. It is not encrypted. System maintainers have access to the database for administration. Reading and extracting data for purposes other than ensuring the system is online and functioning is sticktly prohibited.</p>
      <p>In addition to what you see on the screen, the each project has the following data accosiated with it:
        <ul>
          <li>Project owner (ID)</li>
          <li>User IDs for users the project is shared with</li>
          <li>Last modified date</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Interactions data</h2>
      <p>The system sends an "interaction message" to the ODI Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system (HubSpot) each time you do any of the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Login</li>
          <li>Start an assessment</li>
          <li>Complete an assessment</li>
          <li>Delete account or assessment/s</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <p>This data is shared so the ODI can monitor:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Number of active users (last login, number of times logged in)</li>
          <li>Number of assessments in progress</li>
          <li>Number of completed assessments</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>This data helps us measure the popularity of the system and make the case for additional development and funding.</p>
      <p>This data is stored against your record in the CRM system and can be managed alongside your account via the Open Data Institute website.</p>

    <h1>Exercising your rights over data about you and projects</h1>
    <div class="infobox">
      <h2>User data</h2>
      <p>The system stores very little user data. Access to user data is not necessary as it will only tell you your own name and email.</p>
      <p>If you wish to delete your account you can do this from the <a href="/profile">profile</a> page.</p><p><b>Note:</b> This does not delete your ODI account, just the accosiated record in this system. We do not achieve the account, it is deleted and we do not store a reocrd of this operation.</p>
      <h2>Project data</h2>
      <p>All project data can be download from within the system as JSON, which is the format it is stored in, so there is very little difference between this and the stored data. The main difference is that we remove the IDs of users your project might be shared with.</p><p>If you delete a project, it is gone, we do not archive, it is deleted there and then. The only place it will exist is with an automated backup.</p>
      <h2>Backups</h2>
      <p>We take backups of the system purely to ensure that in the event of a disaster we can restore the system to a good state. Should this happen it may be discovered that data has been restored that a user has deleted. This is a rare occurance and we will contact users to let them know that a backup has been restored and communicate the impact on saved/restored data.</p>
