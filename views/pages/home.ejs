          Consequence Scanning is a way for organisations to think about the potential impact of their product or service on people and society. With Consequence Scanning, organisations will be able to anticipate and address concerns they might have early on in the development cycle, before the final product is shipped.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through Consequence Scanning, you consider the potential consequences of what you&rsquo;re building and document the potential outcomes in order to provide you with the opportunity to mitigate or address potential harms or disasters before they happen.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>This interactive tool provides a framework to carry out a Consequence Scanning activity and generate a risk register that can be downloaded and incorporated into your project planning and governance.</p>

            <h3>Select from example case studies:</h3>
            <p> Learn how to conduct a Consequence Scan by working through one of our example case studies and identify consequences, determine risks and plan actions.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Start a new project:</h3>

  <h2>Supported by AI</h2>
  <p>The tool uses a ChatGPT plugin to assist you in the process of Consequence Scanning. Throughout the tool you will have the option to generate suggestions and ideas for your project in order to help you identify consequences and plan risk mitigation.</p>
  <b>You can use the AI to help you:</b>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Carry out an automated risk assessment:</b> Provide a detailed description of your project as well as data used and let the AI do a first draft for you of everything from consequenes to actions, giving you a risk regisiter in less that 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Suggest consequences:</b> Both positive and negative, that might arise from your data project, which you can selectively add to your evaluation.</li>
        <li><b>Assess risk:</b> The tool will assess the impact and likelihood of these consequences to help you prioritise and manage risks effectively.</li>
        <li><b>Create actions:</b> The AI will generate specific actions to mitigate and manage identified consequences.</li>
        <li><b>Recommend KPIs: </b>&nbsp;The tool will also recommend Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for your actions in order to track the effectiveness of your risk mitigation actions.</li>
    </ul>
